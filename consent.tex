\section*{Consent}
The consent statement is required for articles involving patient data or information (e.g. personal genomics articles, case reports, clinical trials etc). You must ensure you have written informed consent from all the patients involved (or their legal guardian for a minor, or next of kin if the patient is deceased).

Please therefore add a line in your article under this heading stating 'Written informed consent for publication of their clinical details and/or clinical images was obtained from the patient/parent/guardian/ relative of the patient.'
