\subsection*{Participants}

Acquisition of the data described herein was part of a previously published
\cite{Hanke_2014}, and took place in close temporal proximity (no more than a
few weeks apart). The participants in this data release are identical to those
previously reported \cite{Hanke_2014}.  They were fully instructed about the
nature of the study and were paid a total of 100 EUR for their participation,
which included the previously reported data acquisitions, as well as the one
described herein. All data acquisitions were jointly approved by the ethics
committee of the Otto-von-Guericke-University of Magdeburg, Germany.

\subsection*{Procedures and stimulation setup}

\subsection*{Functional MRI data acquisition}

The acquisition protocol for functional MRI was largely identical with the one
previously reported \cite{Hanke_2014}, hence only differences and key facts are
listed here.

Importantly, the same landmark-based procedure for automatic slice positioning
that was used to align the scanner field-of-view between acquisition sessions,
was used again to align the field-of-view for this acquisition with the one in
the previous study \cite{Hanke_2014}. As the exact same alignment target was
used, this led to a very similar field-of-view configuration across
acquisitions.

Each acquisition run consisted of 153 volumes, for a total of eight runs.

\subsection*{Physiological recordings}

The cardiac and respiratory trace was recorded for the full duration of all
eight runs. The acquisition setup for physiological was identical with the one
previously reported \cite{Hanke_2014}.
