To give an extendend reference for music pattern discrimination across the audio book from [add forrest paper] a less complex stimulation with music could be used as reference or classifier validaiton/ testing. The aim could be to predict the music played in the audio book, using the annotionns of music played in the movie.

audio movie has lots of music

studying music perception in a complex stimulus becomes easier if there is a simpler reference

this is the reference

The complexity of the different kind of music (spectra, depth, preference etc.)  contribute to differnet state of minds which can be analysis separately, especially in connection with (more detailed) annotions of the movie or different ROI based analyses.
